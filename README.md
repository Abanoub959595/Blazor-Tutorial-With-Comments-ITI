# Blazor Tutorial with Comprehensive Comments

A progressive Blazor learning project developed during my ITI scholarship, documenting my journey from basic concepts to API integration through heavily commented code examples.

## Project Purpose
- Demonstrate fundamental Blazor concepts with explanatory comments
- Show my progression from static data rendering to dynamic API calls
- Serve as a reference for Blazor best practices and patterns
- Document my learning journey during the ITI scholarship program

## Features
- **Basic Blazor Components** - Static data rendering with component basics  
- **Data Binding** - One-way and two-way binding examples  
- **Dependency Injection** - Service registration and consumption  
- **API Integration** - Progressive examples from mock data to real API calls  
- **State Management** - Basic state handling patterns  
- **Routing** - Navigation between components

Note: The last two lines in your screenshot appear to be editor instructions (about Control+Shift+M) and possibly some accidental text that shouldn't be in the README.

Key corrections made:
1. Fixed "Comprehension Commits" → "Comprehensive Comments"
2. "documentize" → "documenting"
3. "Serve at" → "Serve as"
4. "Document by" → "Document my"
5. "Data Handry" → "Data Binding"
6. "Repository Injection" → "Dependency Injection"
7. "Working" → "Routing"
8. Removed the editor instructions at the bottom

Would you like me to:
1. Add any additional sections to this README?
2. Include installation instructions?
3. Add screenshots or badges?
4. Format any part differently?
